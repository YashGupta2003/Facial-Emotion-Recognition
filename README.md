# Facial-Emotion-Recognition
🎭 Facial Emotion Recognition System – AI-Powered Real-Time Analysis
🚀 Developed by: Yash Gupta
🧠 Powered by: TensorFlow | OpenCV | Streamlit

🔥 Project Overview
The Facial Emotion Recognition System is an AI-driven solution that detects and classifies human emotions in real-time video streams with an 89% accuracy rate using the FER 2013 dataset. This project integrates self-learning AI capabilities, continuously improving its predictions over time by dynamically collecting and retraining on new data.

🚀 Key Features:
✅ Real-Time Emotion Detection – Live video analysis for instant recognition.
✅ Self-Learning AI 🤖 – Automatically captures new emotions & improves over time.
✅ Dynamic Emotion Representation – Displays detected emotions with names, emojis & scores.
✅ Live Data Collection & Adaptive Learning – Enhances recognition accuracy with real-world feedback.

⚙️ Technologies Used
🔹 TensorFlow, Keras – Deep learning framework for training and model development.
🔹 OpenCV – Face detection and image processing.
🔹 Streamlit – Interactive web-based user interface.
🔹 Haar Cascade Classifier – Face detection model.
🔹 NumPy – Data handling and manipulation.

🛠 Model Architecture
The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), consisting of:
🔹 Three Convolutional Layers – Feature extraction using ReLU activation and Max Pooling.
🔹 Final Softmax Layer – Multi-class classification for emotions.
🔹 Dropout Layers – Prevents overfitting and improves generalization.
🔹 Adam Optimizer + Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss – Ensures optimal learning and convergence.

📊 Training & Performance
✅ Dataset Used: FER 2013 (Kaggle)
✅ Data Preprocessing: Image augmentation, normalization & data balancing
✅ Train-Test Split: 80% training | 20% validation/testing
✅ Final Accuracy: 🚀 89% (with Early Stopping & Model Checkpointing)

🤯 Revolutionary Self-Learning Feature
This project goes beyond static emotion detection by incorporating a self-learning mechanism:
✅ Captures new user emotions in real-time 📷
✅ Automatically stores new faces & expressions 🧠
✅ Retrains itself continuously for improved accuracy 📈
✅ Adapts to different user emotions & cultural variations 🌍
✅ Enhances future recognition through feedback loops 🔄

📊 Dynamic Emotion Scoring System
Each detected emotion is assigned a score (0-5) to quantify its intensity:
😊 Happy – Score: 5/5
😞 Sad – Score: 1/5
😠 Angry – Score: 1/5
😐 Neutral – Score: 3/5
😮 Surprised – Score: 4/5

This scoring system enables AI-driven decision-making for mental health monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and behavioral studies.

🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 Multi-user emotion detection – Analyze emotions for multiple users simultaneously.
🔹 Voice emotion integration – Expand detection to speech-based emotions.
🔹 Mental health monitoring – AI-driven mood tracking for therapeutic insights.
🔹 AI-powered customer feedback analysis – Emotion-based market research.

This AI is evolving, learning, and redefining real-time human interaction! 🌎
